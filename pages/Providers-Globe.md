# Providers Globe

Each marker on the globe represents the Lat/Long location of the IP address associated with nodes that have been contacted to provide subtask results for my tasks. The size of the mark correlates to the number of times the node provided results. The larger the mark, the more results were provided. This graph includes subtasks that were Failed also.
