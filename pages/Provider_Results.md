# Provider Results

Each marker on the globe represents the Lat/Long location of the IP address associated with nodes that have provided subtask results for my tasks. The node will show here regardless of success or failure. The size of the mark correlates to the number of times the node provided results. The larger the mark, the more results were provided.
