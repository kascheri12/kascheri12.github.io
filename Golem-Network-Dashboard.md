# Golem Network Dashboard


### Golem Network Summary

My most mature graph that I've built to date is this summary of some important network resources and basic node count.

### Daily Aggregate Totals

This is a new one I'm trying to understand and nail down. The idea is that I'm finding the average values for these measurements on the date based on all the snapshots I have accumulated for that date. Many nodes can come and go throughout the day so I thought that an average would be more accurate.
